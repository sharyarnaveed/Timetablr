#PROBLEM STATEMENT
[The University Timetable Management System is a web application that streamlines access to class schedules by providing
personalized timetables based on user preferences. When a user, such as a student or faculty member, logs in, the system
displays only the class information relevant to their selected semester and department. The application operates by uploading the university
timetable as a PDF, extracting and storing the data in a database. At any given time, for example, if a user opens the site at 11 AM, the application
will display only the classes occurring at that specific time, including details like class time, teacher name, and venue. This ensures that users see 
only the information pertinent to their current schedule, enhancing convenience andÂ efficiency.]
